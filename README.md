# Regex Data Extraction - GLOR205

I built this project as part of a task to extract specific types of data from raw text using Python and regular expressions.

The goal was to simulate part of a web application backend that pulls large amounts of string data and filters out relevant info like:

- Email addresses
- URLs
- Phone numbers
- Hashtags

### How it works

The script (`main.py`) loads a `.json` file (`test_data.json`) with social media profile data and uses regex patterns to find and print the above data types.

### To run it

Make sure you have Python installed. Then just do:

```bash
python main.py
